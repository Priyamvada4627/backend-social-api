Social Media Backend API (FastAPI)

A backend REST API built using FastAPI that enables users to communicate through posts and interact with content through likes.
This project is developed by following a comprehensive FastAPI tutorial and focuses on real-world backend development concepts such as CRUD operations, relational data modeling, and scalable API design.

The backend forms the foundation of a social media platform where users can create posts, like posts created by other users, and view engagement on posts.

Features

1.Create posts for communication

2.Retrieve all posts or a specific post

3.Update and delete posts

4.Like posts created by other users

5.View which users liked a particular post

6.View which posts are liked by a user

7.RESTful API design

8.Request and response validation using Pydantic

9.Automatic API documentation (Swagger UI)

10.Modular and scalable backend structure
